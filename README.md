# Homework-1031

This project involves refactoring and optimizing foundational Java code examples from "Chapter 2" and "Chapter 3" of the course materials.

## Key Updates

* **[Sample2_1](https://github.com/liu7388/Homework-1113/blob/main/CH2/Sample2_1.java) : Input Refactoring (Scanner)** \
Replaced the cumbersome `BufferedReader` with `Scanner` to simplify user input. This leverages built-in methods like `nextInt()` for automatic type conversion and removes the need for manual parsing and `IOException` handling. 

* **[Sample2_7](https://github.com/liu7388/Homework-1113/blob/main/CH2/Sample2_7.java) : Conditional Logic Simplification** \
Modernized `if` statements by replacing multi-condition `||` (OR) checks for case sensitivity. Implemented `Character.toUpperCase()` to standardize input, resulting in a single, cleaner, and more robust comparison.

* **[Sample3_23](https://github.com/liu7388/Homework-1113/blob/main/CH3/Sample3_23.java) : OOP Enhancement (Constructor Overloading)** \
Improved the `Car` class (Sample3_23) by adding an overloaded constructor. This allows for flexible object instantiation, giving the choice between creating a default object or an object fully initialized with data from the start.
